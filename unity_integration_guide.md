# Unity Integration Guide

This guide outlines how to integrate the core components of the game with Unity3D and VR technologies, including Meta Quest 2, touch controllers, and XR interaction toolkit.

## Prefab Factory

The Prefab Factory is responsible for creating and managing game prefabs. You can create new prefabs and retrieve them by type.

### Usage

```csharp
PrefabFactory prefabFactory = new PrefabFactory();
prefabFactory.CreatePrefab('sword', new { damage = 10, rarity = 'common' });
GameObject swordPrefab = prefabFactory.GetPrefab('sword');
```

## Save System

The Save System handles saving and loading player attributes and inventory.

### Usage

```csharp
SaveSystem saveSystem = new SaveSystem('./saves');
saveSystem.SavePlayer('player1', new { health = 100, level = 1, inventory = new string[] { 'sword' } });
object playerData = saveSystem.LoadPlayer('player1');
```

## Unity Integration

The Unity Integration script serves as a bridge between the core components and Unity3D.

### Usage

```csharp
UnityIntegration unityIntegration = new UnityIntegration();
unityIntegration.CreatePrefab('sword', new { damage = 10, rarity = 'common' });
unityIntegration.SavePlayer('player1', new { health = 100, level = 1, inventory = new string[] { 'sword' } });
object playerData = unityIntegration.LoadPlayer('player1');
```

## VR Support

To enable VR support with Meta Quest 2, touch controllers, and XR interaction toolkit, follow the official Unity3D documentation for VR integration.

This integration ensures that the game is compatible with industry-standard VR technologies and provides an immersive experience for players.
